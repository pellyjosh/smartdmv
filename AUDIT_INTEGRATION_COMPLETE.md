## 🔧 **INTEGRATION PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**

### **For API Routes:**

```typescript
import { logCreate, logView, logUpdate, logDelete } from "@/lib/audit-logger";
import { getUserContextFromStandardRequest } from "@/lib/auth-context";

// In your API handler:
const auditUserContext = await getUserContextFromStandardRequest(request);
if (auditUserContext) {
  await logCreate(
    request,
    "RECORD_TYPE",
    recordId,
    recordData,
    auditUserContext.userId,
    auditUserContext.practiceId,
    reason, // optional
    metadata // optional
  );
}
```

### **For Server Actions:**

```typescript
import { createAuditLog } from "@/lib/audit-logger";

await createAuditLog({
  action: "CREATE",
  recordType: "USER",
  recordId: user.id,
  description: "Created new user",
  userId: currentUser.id,
  practiceId: currentUser.practiceId,
  metadata: {
    /* additional context */
  },
});
```

## 🚀 **READY FOR EXPANSION**

### **Next Priority APIs (Ready for Integration):**

1. **Pet Management** (`src/app/api/pets/route.ts`) - Template ready
2. **Prescriptions** (`src/app/api/prescriptions/route.ts`) - Medical compliance
3. **Lab Results** (`src/app/api/lab/results/route.ts`) - Medical data
4. **Permission Overrides** (`src/app/api/permission-overrides/route.ts`) - Security critical
5. **Treatments** (`src/app/api/treatments/route.ts`) - Medical procedures

### **Bulk Integration Script Available:**

- Pattern detection for common operations
- Automated import addition
- Template generation for consistent implementation
- Located: `audit-integration-automation.js`
