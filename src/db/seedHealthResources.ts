# Pet Dental Care: At-Home and Professional

Good dental care is essential for your pet's overall health and wellbeing.

## Signs of Dental Problems

### Watch for These Warning Signs
- Bad breath
- Yellow or brown tartar buildup
- Red, swollen gums
- Difficulty eating or chewing
- Pawing at face or mouth
- Loose or missing teeth

## At-Home Dental Care

### Daily Brushing
- Use pet-specific toothpaste (never human toothpaste)
- Start slowly, let pet get used to the process
- Focus on outer surfaces of teeth
- Reward with praise and treats

### Dental Chews and Toys
- Look for VOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council) seal
- Appropriate size for your pet
- Monitor for wear and replace when needed

### Dental Diets
- Specially formulated kibble texture
- Helps reduce plaque and tartar
- Discuss with your veterinarian

## Professional Dental Care

### When Professional Cleaning is Needed
- Annual dental exams reveal need
- Tartar buildup below gum line
- Signs of periodontal disease
- Bad breath despite home care

### What Happens During Professional Cleaning
1. **Pre-anesthetic examination** and bloodwork
2. **Anesthesia** for patient comfort and safety
3. **Thorough examination** of all teeth and gums
4. **Scaling** to remove tartar above and below gum line
5. **Polishing** to smooth tooth surfaces
6. **Dental X-rays** if needed
7. **Extractions** of severely diseased teeth

## Age-Specific Dental Care

### Puppies and Kittens
- Teething typically occurs at 3-6 months
- Provide appropriate chew toys
- Begin tooth brushing early

### Adult Pets
- Daily brushing ideal
- Annual dental exams
- Professional cleaning as recommended

### Senior Pets
- More frequent dental exams
- Monitor for tooth loss
- Softer foods may be needed

## Dental Disease Prevention

### The 3-2-1 Rule
- **3**: Brush teeth 3 times per week minimum
- **2**: Use 2 forms of dental care (brushing + treats/diet)
- **1**: Professional cleaning at least once yearly

Remember: Dental disease doesn't just affect the mouth - bacteria can spread to the heart, liver, and kidneys!
