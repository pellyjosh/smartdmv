# 1. Create audit middleware that can wrap existing API routes
# 2. Create higher-order functions for common patterns
# 3. Provide easy integration methods for existing routes
# 4. Test with key APIs first, then expand

INTEGRATION STRATEGY:

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Audit logger with helper functions
- âœ… User context extraction
- âœ… Database schema and migrations

Phase 2: Critical APIs (IN PROGRESS)
- âœ… Users API (create, view)
- âœ… Appointments API (create, view)
- ðŸ”„ Authentication events
- ðŸ”„ Permission changes
- ðŸ”„ Medical records (SOAP notes, prescriptions, lab results)

Phase 3: Business Logic APIs
- Pet management
- Inventory operations
- Treatment workflows
- Billing operations

Phase 4: System Operations
- Configuration changes
- Reports and exports
- Administrative actions

CURRENT STATUS:
- Audit infrastructure: Complete
- User context: Complete  
- Users API: Complete with audit logging
- Appointments API: Complete with audit logging
- Next: Authentication and authorization APIs
