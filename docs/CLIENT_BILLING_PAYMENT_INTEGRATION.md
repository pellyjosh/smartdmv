# Client Billing Payment Integration

## Overview

The client billing page (`/src/app/client/billing/page.tsx`) has been updated to use the new simplified payment handler system. This provides automatic provider selection and seamless payment processing.

## What Changed

### ✅ New Implementation

#### **Function: `processPaymentWithHandler()`**

Replaces the old complex payment processing logic with a simple, clean implementation.

**Location**: Lines ~157-208 in `page.tsx`

**What it does**:

1. Takes an invoice as input
2. Calls the `/api/payments/create` endpoint
3. Passes invoice details, amount, and user email
4. Receives payment URL from the system
5. Redirects user to Stripe or Paystack checkout page

**Code**:

```typescript
const processPaymentWithHandler = async (invoice: Invoice) => {
  try {
    setIsProcessingPayment(true);

    // Call the new payment creation API
    const response = await fetch("/api/payments/create", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      credentials: "include",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        practiceId: (invoice as any).practiceId || 1,
        amount: parseFloat(invoice.totalAmount),
        email: user?.email || billingInfoForm.receiptEmail,
        description: `Invoice #${invoice.invoiceNumber}`,
        metadata: {
          invoiceId: invoice.id,
          invoiceNumber: invoice.invoiceNumber,
          clientId: user?.id,
          clientName: user?.name,
        },
      }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();

    if (!result.success) {
      throw new Error(result.error || "Payment failed");
    }

    toast({
      title: "Redirecting to Payment",
      description: `Opening ${result.provider} checkout page...`,
    });

    // Redirect to payment URL
    window.location.href = result.paymentUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    setIsProcessingPayment(false);
    toast({
      title: "Payment Failed",
      description: error.message,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  }
};
```

#### **Updated: `handlePayInvoice()`**

Now directly calls the new payment handler instead of the old complex logic.

**Before** (80+ lines):

- Manual provider selection based on currency
- Multiple API calls to fetch practice details
- Separate logic for Stripe vs Paystack
- Complex conditional rendering

**After** (15 lines):

```typescript
const handlePayInvoice = (invoice: Invoice) => {
  setSelectedInvoice(invoice);
  setPaymentForm((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    amount: parseFloat(invoice.totalAmount),
  }));

  // Automatically process payment using the new payment handler
  processPaymentWithHandler(invoice);
};
```

#### **Simplified: `processPayment()`**

The old `processPayment()` function (150+ lines) has been simplified to delegate to the new handler.

**Old**: 150+ lines of Stripe SDK imports, card prompts, error handling
**New**: 5 lines that delegate to `processPaymentWithHandler()`

```typescript
const processPayment = async () => {
  if (!selectedInvoice) return;
  // Use the new simplified payment handler instead
  processPaymentWithHandler(selectedInvoice);
};
```

## User Flow

### When User Clicks "Pay Now"

```
1. User clicks "Pay Now" on an invoice
   ↓
2. handlePayInvoice() is called
   ↓
3. processPaymentWithHandler() is invoked
   ↓
4. API call to /api/payments/create with invoice details
   ↓
5. Backend (payment-handler.ts) automatically:
   - Gets practice currency from DB
   - Finds which provider supports that currency
   - Gets practice's API keys
   - Creates payment with Stripe or Paystack
   ↓
6. Frontend receives payment URL
   ↓
7. Toast notification shows "Redirecting to {provider}..."
   ↓
8. User is redirected to Stripe/Paystack checkout page
   ↓
9. User completes payment on provider's page
   ↓
10. Provider redirects back to success/failure page
```

2. **Automatic Provider Selection**:

   - No manual currency checking
   - No hardcoded provider logic
   - System picks provider based on DB configuration

3. **Better Error Handling**:

   - Clear error messages
   - Consistent toast notifications
   - No silent failures

4. **Maintainability**:

   - One place to update payment logic (payment-handler.ts)
   - Frontend just calls API endpoint
   - Easy to test

5. **Scalability**:
   - Add new providers without changing frontend
   - Update provider logic without touching UI
   - Database-driven configuration

---

## What Was Removed

### ❌ Deleted Code

1. **Manual Currency Detection** (30 lines):

```typescript
// OLD - Removed
const res = await fetch(`/api/practices/${practiceId}`);
const practice = await res.json();
const currencyCode = practice?.currency?.code;
if (currencyCode === "NGN") {
  provider = "paystack";
} else {
  provider = "stripe";
}
```

2. **Separate Paystack Initialization** (40 lines):

```typescript
// OLD - Removed
const res = await fetch("/api/billing/payments", {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    provider: "paystack",
    // ... lots of params
  }),
});
const url = json.authorization_url;
window.location.href = url;
```

3. **Stripe SDK Loading** (80 lines):

```typescript
// OLD - Removed
const [{ loadStripe }, { Elements, CardElement }] = await Promise.all([
  import("@stripe/stripe-js"),
  import("@stripe/react-stripe-js"),
]);
const stripe = await loadStripe(key);
const cardNumber = window.prompt("Enter card number");
// ... complex card handling
```

4. **Payment Method Dialogs**:
   - showProviderDialog state (no longer needed)
   - Manual provider selection UI (removed)

---

## Testing

### Test the New Flow

1. **With USD Invoice** (should use Stripe):

```typescript
// Click "Pay Now" on USD invoice
// Should show: "Redirecting to Stripe..."
// Should redirect to: Stripe checkout page
```

2. **With NGN Invoice** (should use Paystack):

```typescript
// Click "Pay Now" on NGN invoice
// Should show: "Redirecting to Paystack..."
// Should redirect to: Paystack checkout page
```

3. **With Unsupported Currency**:

```typescript
// Should show error: "No payment provider configured for currency XXX"
```

4. **With Missing API Keys**:

```typescript
// Should show error: "stripe not configured for this practice"
```

---

## API Endpoint Used

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/payments/create`

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "practiceId": 1,
  "amount": 50.0,
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "description": "Invoice #INV-001",
  "metadata": {
    "invoiceId": 123,
    "invoiceNumber": "INV-001",
    "clientId": 456,
    "clientName": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

**Response (Success)**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "paymentId": "pi_1234567890",
  "provider": "stripe"
}
```

**Response (Error)**:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "provider": "stripe",
  "error": "Insufficient funds"
}
```

## Migration Notes

### For Other Pages

If you have other pages that process payments (e.g., appointment booking, product checkout), use the same pattern:

```typescript
// Example: Appointment Booking Payment
const handlePayForAppointment = async (appointment) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/payments/create", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      practiceId: appointment.practiceId,
      amount: appointment.totalCost,
      email: user.email,
      description: `Appointment with ${appointment.vetName}`,
      metadata: {
        appointmentId: appointment.id,
        serviceType: appointment.serviceType,
      },
    }),
  });

  const result = await response.json();

  if (result.success) {
    window.location.href = result.paymentUrl;
  }
};
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Old Functions Kept

These functions are still in the code but marked as LEGACY:

- `processPayment()` - Now delegates to new handler
- `showPaymentDialog` - Still works for manual payments
- Payment method management - Unchanged

### Safe to Remove Later

Once you verify everything works:

- Old provider selection logic
- Stripe SDK import code
- Manual card detail prompts
- Separate Paystack initialization

---

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/client/billing/page.tsx`
   - Added: `processPaymentWithHandler()`
   - Updated: `handlePayInvoice()`
   - Simplified: `processPayment()`
   - Removed: 180+ lines of old payment logic

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Payment Flow**:
