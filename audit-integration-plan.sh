# Audit Integration Plan for SmartDMV Veterinary System
# This file documents the integration strategy for audit logging across all API routes

echo "=== AUDIT LOGGING INTEGRATION PLAN ==="

echo "
PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL OPERATIONS (HIGH SECURITY IMPACT):
- Users (create, update, delete, view sensitive data)
- Authentication (login, logout, password changes)
- Permission overrides and role assignments
- Practice configurations and settings
- Financial/billing operations
- Prescription creation and modifications

PRIORITY 2 - BUSINESS CRITICAL (MODERATE SECURITY IMPACT):
- Appointments (create, update, cancel, status changes)
- Pet records (create, update, medical info changes)
- SOAP notes and medical records
- Lab results and medical imaging
- Treatments and procedures
- Inventory management (stock levels, usage)

PRIORITY 3 - OPERATIONAL (LOWER SECURITY IMPACT):
- Dashboard views and reports
- Search operations
- Notification preferences
- Non-sensitive configuration changes
- File uploads (non-medical)

AUDIT LOGGING STRATEGY:
1. CREATE operations: Always log with full 'after' data
2. UPDATE operations: Always log with 'before' and 'after' data
3. DELETE operations: Always log with full 'before' data
4. VIEW operations: Log for sensitive data only (medical records, financial data, PII)
5. EXPORT operations: Always log with export parameters
6. AUTHENTICATION: Always log all attempts (success/failure)

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Start with existing API routes in priority order
2. Add audit logging using helper functions from audit-logger.ts
3. Ensure user context extraction works for both authenticated and system operations
4. Test each integration with sample data
5. Add error handling to ensure audit failures don't break main operations
